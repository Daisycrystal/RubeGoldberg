According to Wikipedia, A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption, invention, device or apparatus that is deliberately over-engineered or overdone to perform a very simple task in a very complicated fashion, usually including a chain reaction. The expression is named after American cartoonist and inventor Rube Goldberg (1883â€“1970).

In this project, we have tried to simulate a simple rube goldberg machine, whose objective is to switch on a wall-mounted TV.

Our setup consists of a ball which is made to run down a slide, pass through a ring and fall on a set of dominoes, initiating a domino effect. The TV mounted on a wall in the same hall switches on when the last domino falls on the TV's switch.

Game plan:
The user is provided with a Play button initially when the page loads. 
The canvas is made to appear on screen and WebGL is set up and the animation is rendered when the user presses this button.

For camera navigation, the user can zoom in (upto a limit), zoom out (till a limit), move the camera head up, down, left, right.

Computer Graphics Concepts that have been covered:
1. Lighting
2. Collision- Collision will bring about change in the state of the whole machine.
3. Transformation- The user can control the navigation of the camera.
4. Texture mapping on all the objects

Modules and Technical Specifics:
The webpage has been verified to run well on Mozilla Firefox.
<video> tag is used to render video in the TV.
Twitter bootstrap is used to provide style to the Project name and play button on the webpage

1)SETUP:

-->Create a server (we used the command python -m SimpleHTTPServer to create one in ubuntu)
-->Host the component1.html file on the server

2) USER INTERACTION:

--> Click on play
--> arrow keys up,down,right,left help in navigating the room.
--> keys i and m help in zooming in and out of the room.
